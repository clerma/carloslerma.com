  title: About Me
  text: ' <p> I’m Carlos—a designer-turned-developer, photographer, and business owner rooted in Lafayette, Louisiana. My journey started in church media over 20 years ago and has since grown into a multi-faceted career that spans web and app development, branding, photography, and hospitality.  I currently serve as COO and full-stack developer at Accolades I.T., and own several ventures including Ohh Snap Booth, Java Square Café, and Carlos + Ashley Photography. I’m passionate about using design and technology to help others tell their story—and I love coffee enough to roast and serve it daily.  Let’s build something that lasts. </p> '

            learning new tools, and the real-world demands of running businesses
            across design, development, photography, and operations. I’ve built
            my career not in classrooms but through projects, problem-solving,
            and perseverance.
